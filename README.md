`pvEBayes` is an R package that implements a suite of nonparametric empirical
Bayes methods for pharmacovigilance, including the Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (GPS),
K-gamma, general-gamma, Koenker-Mizera (KM), and Efron models. It provides tools
for fitting these models to the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) frequency 
tables, extracting summaries, performing hyperparameter tuning, and generating 
graphical summaries (eye plots and heatmaps) for signal detection and signal 
strength estimation. The package does not perform SRS frequency table 
preprocessing, such as raw individual case safety reports (ICSRs) aggregrating. 
These steps should be handled before using `pvEBayes`.

**Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) Table**: An drug safety SRS dataset 
catalogs AE reports on *I* AE rows across *J* drug columns. Let ${N_{ij}}$ 
denote the number of reported cases for the *i*-th AE and the *j*-th drug, 
where ${i = 1,..., I}$ and ${j = 1,..., J}$. 

**Empirical Bayes modeling for SRS data mining**: 

  - Model each AE-drug count as 
  $N_{ij} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{ij} E_{ij})$, $N_{ij} = 0, 1, 2, \dots$
  
  - $E_{ij}$: expected baseline value assuming no AE-drug association.
  
  - $\lambda_{ij} > 0$: relative reporting ratio / signal strength for the 
  (i,j)-th AE-drug pair (multiplicative deviation from the null baseline value).


**From signal detection to signal strength $\lambda$ estimation**

  - Traditional SRS data mining emphasizes **signal detection**: 
  identify AE-drug pairs with observed counts substantially larger than 
  its null value, i.e., $\lambda_{ij} > 1$.
  
  - Tan et al. (*Stat. in Med.*, 2025) extend this to 
  **signal strength estimation**: estimate $\{\lambda_{ij}\}$ and quantify 
  uncertainty via flexible nonparametric empirical Bayes posterior distribution.
  
  - Signal estimation helps distinguish AE-drug pairs that look identical under 
  a binary signal detection framework (e.g., $\lambda=1.5$ vs $\lambda=4.0$), 
  which can have different clinical implications.

**Methods implemented in `pvEBayes` (differ by prior assumptions):**

  - Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (GPS)
  
  - Koenker–Mizera method (KM)
  
  - Efron’s nonparametric empirical Bayes approach
  
  - K-gamma method
  
  - General-gamma method
  
**Why nonparametric priors?**

  - GPS uses a 2 gamma mixture prior motivated by a signal/non-signal structure.
  
  - Real-world signal strengths $\lambda_{ij}$ can be heterogeneous, and the 
  underlying (prior) distribution over $\lambda_{ij}$ may be multi-modal with
  multiple distinct peaks, making simple parametric priors hard to justify.
  
  - Nonparametric empirical Bayes methods (KM, Efron, general-gamma) address 
  this challenge by utilizing a flexible prior with a general mixture form and 
  estimating the prior distribution in a data-driven way. 

**Implementation highlights:**

  - Provides a fully open-source KM implementation using `CVXR` (avoids reliance 
  on the commercial Mosek solver used by `REBayes`).
  
  - Adapts Efron’s approach from `deconvolveR` to support the exposure/offset 
  $E_{ij}$ in the Poisson model (not supported in the original implementation).
  
  - Implements the bi-level Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm 
  from Tan et al. (*Stat. in Med.*, 2025) for prior estimation for 
  gamma-mixture prior based models (GPS, K-gamma, general-gamma).
  
  - Supports AIC/BIC-based hyperparameter tuning for $\alpha$ in the 
  general-gamma model and $(p, c_0)$ in Efron's approach (see Tan et al. 
  (*Stat. in Med.*, 2025) for further detail).

## Installation

The stable version of `pvEBayes` can be installed from CRAN:

```
install.packages("pvEBayes")
```

The development version is available from GitHub:

```
# if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YihaoTancn/pvEBayes")
```

## Quick Example

Here is a minimal example analyzing the built-in FDA statin44 dataset with
general-gamma model:

```

library(pvEBayes)

# Load the statin44 contingency table of 44 AEs for 6 statins
data("statin2025_44")

# Fit a general-gamma model with a specified alpha
fit <- pvEBayes(
  contin_table      = statin2025_44,
  model             = "general-gamma",
  alpha             = 0.3,
  n_posterior_draws = 1000
)

# Expected output is given below. Note that the running time for model fitting 
# and posterior draw generation may vary depending on the computing environment.

# ✔ Fitting general-gamma model... [1.6s]
# ✔ Generating 1000 posterior draws... [75ms]
# Object of class 'pvEBayes'
# 
# General-gamma model with hyperparameter alpha = 0.3.
# Estimated prior is a mixture of 18 gamma distributions.
# 
# Running time of the general-gamma model fitting: 1.6154 seconds.
# Optimizer convergence: successful.
# Running time for posterior draws 
# (1000 signal strength posterior draws per AE-drug pair):0.0975 seconds.
# 
# Extract estimated prior parameters, discovered signals
# and signal strength posterior draws using `summary()`.


# Obtain a logical matrix for the detected signal
summary(fit, return = "detected signal")

# Visualize posterior distributions for top AE-drug pairs
plot(fit, type = "eyeplot")

```
